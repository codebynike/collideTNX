# 🚀 CollideTNX — Blockchain-Powered P2E Gaming Platform on Stacks

Welcome to **collideTNX**, a decentralized Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming ecosystem built on the **Stacks blockchain**. CollideTNX merges the thrill of in-game competition with blockchain technology, enabling players to earn, trade, and govern using **TNX tokens** and **game NFTs** in a transparent, secure, and community-driven environment.

## 🎮 Overview

**CollideTNX** is designed to create a decentralized, player-owned gaming world where in-game assets and rewards are tokenized as NFTs and fungible tokens (TNX). Players can earn, trade, and stake their assets while participating in events, battles, and tournaments — all governed by smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain using the **Clarity** language.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* 💰 **TNX Token Economy**: Minting, burning, and transferring the native TNX token based on player activities.
* 🧩 **NFT Minting & Upgrades**: Dynamic NFT creation, ownership, and progression.
* 🏆 **Play-to-Earn Rewards**: Earn TNX and NFTs through gameplay, challenges, and leaderboards.
* 🔐 **Staking & Yield Farming**: Stake TNX tokens or NFTs for passive rewards.
* 🛒 **Marketplace & Auctions**: Decentralized NFT trading and escrow-secured transactions.
* 🗳️ **Governance DAO**: TNX holders vote on updates, features, and rule changes.
* 🎯 **Event Smart Contracts**: Automated events with on-chain leaderboards and rewards.
* 🛡️ **Anti-Cheat & Auditing**: Transparent and secure smart contracts to ensure fair play.
* 🌉 **Cross-Chain Compatibility (Future)**: Bridge assets from other blockchains into the CollideTNX world.

## 📐 Smart Contract Architecture

Each module of the game is governed by Clarity smart contracts. Below are the key components:

### 1. **TNX Token Contract**

* Fungible token (SIP-010 compliant)
* Minting based on in-game activity
* Burning on transaction fees or purchases
* Secure transfer mechanics

### 2. **NFT Contracts**

* Mint NFTs: Avatars, weapons, vehicles, land
* Upgrade logic for evolving NFTs
* Event-driven minting (e.g., limited editions)
* Ownership transfer and trade validation

### 3. **Rewards & P2E Contracts**

* Auto-distribute TNX based on milestones, battles
* Loot boxes with verifiable randomness
* Leaderboard-based reward pools

### 4. **Staking Contracts**

* Lock TNX/NFTs for defined periods
* Yield farming and exclusive access rewards
* Penalties for early withdrawals

### 5. **Marketplace & Auction Contracts**

* Direct buy/sell listings
* Time-based auctions with minimum bid thresholds
* Escrow system for secure asset exchange

### 6. **Governance Contracts (DAO)**

* Proposal submission and voting
* Automatic rule or parameter updates
* Community-driven roadmap

### 7. **Event Automation**

* In-game events creation
* Participant tracking
* Automated prize distribution

### 8. **Security & Anti-Cheat**

* Action logging and abuse detection
* Transparent audit trails on-chain

## 📦 Deployment Guide

1. Connect Hiro Wallet to your devnet/testnet/mainnet.
2. Use Clarinet or deploy via the Hiro Explorer UI.

```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* All logic is on-chain, reducing centralized risk.
* NFTs and TNX tokens follow SIP standards.
* Contracts audited (or planned to be audited) by third-party firms.
* Anti-bot and abuse detection included in core gameplay logic.
